# Machine-Learning-A-Z
This repository is in conjunction with the Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science course offered by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves on Udemy.

It will contain all the codes on the topics which the instructors have discussed in the course. All codes will be in Python programming language.
This repository will also contain some variants on the proposed methods and extra codes (projects not discussed in the course) which I will come across my journey of this course.
